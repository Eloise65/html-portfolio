<h1>About us</h1>
<h2>Brand Story</h2>  
<p>G & T. CO first came to light with the arrival of the new puppy. We saw a gap in the pet supply industry. Bringing home a new puppy is an exciting time, but also a very busy time having to run around picking up puppy supplies with a new puppy in tow can prove to be quite a challenging experience. Thatâ€™s where our puppy packs come in place.The goal is to set up new owners with all the basic needs of a new puppy, excluding foods.</p>
